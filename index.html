                <p>This is a page I created to try out ideas I've come across while surfing the web.</p>
                <p>This particular idea I was intimidated by at first. I thought how in the world did they get the circles to line up on each the two layers. Then it occurred to me, it was an illusion. There was only one circle on the background. A smaller div with a white background and a percentage opacity on top. Box shadow was used to create the hovering effect.</p>
